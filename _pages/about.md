I'm a fourth year graduate student from [State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI](https://ime.um.edu.mo/), [Department of ECE](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/ece/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). My research interest includes wireless power transfer (WPT), energy harvesting and DC-DC converter.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yan Lu](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/luyan/zh_CN/index.htm) in Tsinghua University with co-supervisor [Prof. Mo Huang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/mohuang/) in University of Macau. I was advised by [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://yanzhao.scut.edu.cn/open/ExpertInfo.aspx?zjbh=woYYKFmSSJj2JJAv1WpdWQ==)(IEEE Fellow) from [School of Electric Power Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ep/) in [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).
