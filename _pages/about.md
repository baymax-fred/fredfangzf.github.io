My research interest includes wireless power transfer (WPT), modeling and control of power electronic converter, and wireless charging application.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Electrial and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI](https://ime.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) since Aug. 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Yan Lu](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/luyan/zh_CN/index.htm).

I received my Bachelor's Degree in electrical engineering and automation from [Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) with the final year project "The Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Chua's Circuit" which got the grade of A+ under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0024156#0) in 2014, and I received my Master's Degree in power electronics and power drives from [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) with the dissertation named "Transfer Efficiency Analysis and Frequency Stabilization Control for Wireless Power Transfer via Magnetic Resonance Coupling" under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://yanzhao.scut.edu.cn/open/ExpertInfo.aspx?zjbh=woYYKFmSSJj2JJAv1WpdWQ==) (IEEE Fellow) in 2017.

I have worked as research assistant (RA) with [Prof. Wenxing Zhong](https://eecs.nbu.edu.cn/info/3211/15146.htm) (in the team of [Prof. Dehong Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0089075)) in the College of Electrical Engineering, [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) from 2019 to 2022.
