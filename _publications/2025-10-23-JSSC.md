Abstract:

This work presents an input-parallel–output-series (IPOS) high-power-density high-voltage conversion ratio (VCR) topology-level hybrid dc–dc boost converter for small-scale flyweight robots and biomedical applications. On the input side, the series–parallel (SP) switched-capacitor (SC) converter is in parallel with a boost converter to share the high input current, and also provides one more design freedom for the efficiency and power density tradeoff. Meanwhile, the intermediate stage merges the two input branches with a Cockcroft–Walton (CW) voltage multiplier (VM) output stage, in which the capacitors are connected in series for stacking a high output voltage, thereby effectively reducing the inductor current and the capacitor voltage stress. Therefore, the package size of the off-chip passive devices is reduced, and the proposed converter enables a smaller volume and weight, improving the power density. Designed with an 180-nm bipolar–CMOS–DMOS (BCD) process, the proposed converter can interface 5-V input to >150-V output (VCR > 30) with <36-V device voltage rating. Benefit from the proposed hybrid topology, this design obtains up to 76.4-mW/mg gravimetric and 255-mW/mm3 volumetric power density, providing >1.2-W output power with 80% peak efficiency.
